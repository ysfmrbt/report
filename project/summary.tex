To summarize, this report has presented the results of an internship at SeekMake, a software development company that provides digital transformation services to businesses and customers. The internship focused on software testing, with an emphasis on end-to-end testing of the web application developed by SeekMake.

The initial sprints prioritized exploratory testing to uncover functional and usability issues in the web applicationâ€™s Micro Frontends architecture. The insights gained were instrumental in refining test cases for end-to-end testing during the final sprint. This iterative approach ensured that all critical workflows were thoroughly validated before deployment.

This internship was transformative, providing me with hands-on experience in test automation using Playwright and continuous integration through GitHub Actions. Collaborating with a cross-functional Agile team enhanced my communication and problem-solving skills, preparing me for future roles in software quality assurance. Additionally, the challenges of debugging cross-browser issues deepened my technical expertise in compatibility testing.
